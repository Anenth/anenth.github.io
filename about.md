I am Anenth & love to make things on WWW. I started my journey few years ago with CSS and was "wowed" about the awesome things it could do, which made me dream and work on it all day long. Then I came across the various technologies in www and realised my passion is Front End Engineering. I love to work on these new technologies in front end and I've never been bored since.
