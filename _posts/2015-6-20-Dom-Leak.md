# Slow ! Fix it, Getting started with DOM Leaks
Building web apps is fun, its like building a small castle with lots of different parts and it raises to be the shiny new castle, thats the fun part now come the sad part, after the castle is build there might be new modification to be done and some parts of the castle will be totally useless. Its the case with web apps when we add new feature we forget about the some parts which may cause performance issue.

### Javascript Performance
Did your clients/customers complained about the performance of your web app ? How will you get started ?

There are different type of performance issue

- Scripting issue (script executions take a ton of time)
- Rendering issue (DOM manipulation this can solved by React.js)
- DOM Leaks

### Lets look at DOM Leaks
1. ####Profile
	Create a new profile on chrome/canary without any extension this will help you to focus on your app.
2. ####Validate
	Use the dev tools to validate the performance issue is caused by DOM Leaks. Remember to force GC(trash icon) before you start recording.
