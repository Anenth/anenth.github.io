title: Fueling my strength with my weakness
---

I **hardly remember** the memories that happened during my school/college days,
I used to ask my friends *how do they remember what happened 10 years ago*? and
this is one of my weakness. Being a software engineer I write lots of code and I
won’t be able to remember why I wrote a piece of code. So I force myself to
**write code which anyone can understand easily** and I make my commits as small
as possible so that I will have a better understanding why did something.

I am very **lazy** or its better name would be **clever**, I try to use the
easiest way out. The only subject I liked in school was math because the only
thing that matter in the exam is the final result. Being so lazy, I hate
repetitive even if its typing 1 word more every time. I use lots of aliases to
help me being lazy/clever.

Being lazy made me more **organized**, One example is, I hang all my cloths and
arrange it so every morning I don’t have to think what I should wear, I just
wear which ever is the first one.
